            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Meet the team at Fitness First. For those who would like to know more about the team at Fitness First.
                Fitness First was created in within the 1990s. The business was first opened by Mike Balfour in 1993 in
                Bournemouth, UK.
                7 years later it opened up within the Australian market too within the 2000s. In 2003 the company was
                sold to
                Cinven for around Â£404 million and this is when the company ended up going private.
                It opened its first doors to india within 2008 and due to a high debt and competitive competition they
                had to
                close and sell many clubs from Spain, Italy and many other countries
                Fitness First has a passion for fitness as well as owning 39 clubs currently as of 2023 all spread out
                across
                the country as well as many more within the contintent of Asia.
                They are specialised in classes, personal trainers as well as any type of workout that exists. Fitness
                First is
                committed to creating a healthier and brighter future.</p><br>

            <h1>Owner-Aaron</h1>
            <img class="photo" src="img/Employee.png">
            <p>Aaron has been in the Computer industry most of his life and his IT and fitness skills are the perfect
                skills into why he bought and made Fitness First into what it is today. He was also originally from
                Tarporley but moved to Bangor when he saw the opportunity over 7 years today to buy and expand this
                business from a
                small gym into a big gym and a highly profitable business, he saw a view and an image in his head and
                new what he wanted to get done is help improve peoples mental health by using things such as featuring
                gym excersises as well as several other various
                excersises within the gym as well as several facilities such as a cafe and water dispenser machine and
                in fact on certain occassions you may even see him use the gym from time to time. He wanted his gym to
                be different so each excersises is unique and like no other.
                He also fixes most of the computers and the main network if one of them crashes or breaks in the gym
                from time to time due to his vastly improving IT skills, if one fails he will see if he can fix it
                otherwise he will just purchase a new machine to replace the faulty one.</p><br>
            <h1>Owner-Abdul</h1>
            <img class="photo" src="img/Manager.png">
            <p>Abdul has been in the gym and business industry for most if not all of his life so he knows how to make
                the business maximise profit as well as give the occassional PT session here and there to guests and one
                of the reasons he helps in the gym alot is so he can
                help the gyms popularity increase and help the business gain popularity as well as stay fit himself. He
                was from Kuwait but moved to Bangor at such a young age to help make this dream a reality. He is also
                the guy most customers would speak to if there were any problems
                about the PTs. If he sees an opportunity he won't hesitate to go for it as he sees most opportunities as
                a way to improve the business rather than another addition or piece of equipment.</p>
