        Fitness First was created in within the 1990s. The business was first opened by Mike Balfour in 1993 in
        Bournemouth, UK.
        7 years later it opened up within the Australian market too within the 2000s. In 2003 the company was sold to
        Cinven for around Â£404 million and this is when the company ended up going private.
        It opened its first doors to india within 2008 and due to a high debt and competitive competition they had to
        close and sell many clubs from Spain, Italy and many other countries
        Fitness First has a passion for fitness as well as owning 39 clubs currently as of 2023 all spread out across
        the country as well as many more within the contintent of Asia.
